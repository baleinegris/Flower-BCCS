# Testing out Flower Framework on BCCS

Forked from [github.com/PathologyDataScience/BCSS](https://github.com/PathologyDataScience/BCSS). Read the README.md there for installation instructions on the data.
To install dependencies, run, it should work idk:
```bash
python -m venv ./.venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
